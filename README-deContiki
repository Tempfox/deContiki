Welcome to deContiki!

deContiki is a branch of the Contiki operating system (see: http://www.contiki-os.org/)
featuring a 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery Proxy Gateway (6LP-GW) running on the 
deRFgateway for ARM hardware platform provided by Dresden Elektronik (http://www.dresden-elektronik.de).
Since the 6LP-GW implements the ND Optimization for LLNs (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6lowpan-nd-18),
the adapted network stack including this ND optimization for for 6LoWPAN hosts is included too.
It currently supports the deRFnode platform with ATmega128RFA1 based radio modules by Dresden Elektronik.

Main Features
=============
The software running on the deRFgateway platform provides (amongst others) the 
following features:
- Real multiple network interfaces, i.e. an stand-alone Ethernet interface in addition to the radio interface.
- Dual IPv4/IPv6 network stack.
- 6LP-GW for easy integration of a 6LoWPAN network into an existing IP infrastructure.
- "local host" component: beside the 6LP-GW component which does the proxying and forwarding
  between the 6LoWPAN and the LAN, the local host component acts as an IP host in the attached Ethernet LAN
  and allows thus to run additional applications (for example a CoAP/HTTP proxy).

Additional Features
===================
The software provided for the deRFnode platform provides:
- Platform-specific Contiki drivers for the deRFnode
- A modified network stack implementing the ND Optimization for LLNs
