deRFnode example

The deRFnode example is derived from the webserver-ipv6 examples on the avr-atmega128rfa1
platform within the standard Contiki tree

Instead of the Web server application of the standard example, it comprises a small
REST server application based on CoAP and the REST engine 
(http://people.inf.ethz.ch/mkovatsc/erbium.php) contributed by Matthias Kovatsch <kovatsch@inf.ethz.ch>.
There is a small number of resources defined, allowing to switch on/off the LEDs on the deRFnode board,
read the list of Contiki processes on the node or initiate a reboot. 

Requirements
============
- deRFnode for AVR/ARM board (http://www.dresden-elektronik.de/shop/prod151.html)
- deRFmega128-22A00 radio module (http://www.dresden-elektronik.de/shop/prod148.html)
- WInAVR tool chain (http://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr)
- AVR Studio 4 (http://www.atmel.com)
- JTAG adapter, e.g. Atmel JTAGICE mkII  

Configuration settings
======================
The configuration is handled in examples/deRFnode/params.c, which is derived from the respective module
in the official Contiki source tree. 

Building the image
==================
The binary image can be built by calling
	make TARGET=deRFmega128_deRFnode_2XXX2 SILENT=false OPTI=0
	
Flashing the image
==================
Please adjust the following define in examples/deRFnode/Makefile according to your needs

JTAGICEMKII= <path to programmer executable>, e.g. "C:/Program Files (x86)/Atmel/AVR Tools/JTAGICEmkII/jtagiceii.exe"

The image can then be flashed by calling
	make flash
